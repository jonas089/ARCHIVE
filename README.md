# Archived-Repos-2019-2022
Old, educational and deprecated Repos - personal Archive&amp;Graveyard
# What is?
All repositories that are not up to date and don't represent my current level of expertise in the Software engineering field are archived here. \
The reason I archive is to track my learning curve as a developer and to reimagine old ideas in the future. \
Some of these projects are quite interesting and show that I've experience in programming, but they don't represent my current level. \
Therefore this archive is more effective way to store these repos, than keeping each repo on my Github side-by-side with more advanced / actually useful / non-educational projects. \
Most of the repos in this archived were created for educational purposes / practice.
