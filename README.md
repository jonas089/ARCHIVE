# Archived-Repos-2019-2022
Old, educational and deprecated Repos - personal Archive&amp;Graveyard
# What is?
All repositories that are not up to date and don't represent my current level of expertise in the Software engineering field are archived here. \
The reason I archive is to track my learning curve as a developer and to reimagine old ideas in the future. \
Some of these projects are quite interesting and show that I've experience in programming, but they don't represent my current level. \
Therefore this archive is more effective way to store these repos, than keeping each repo on my Github side-by-side with more advanced / actually useful / non-educational projects. \
Most of the repos in this archived were created for educational purposes / practice.
## Brief Overview of Projects
### Casper-Metrics
A tool to analyse Casper on-chain data, deprecated as I've built a better one.
### CryptOS-complete
Mobile app, API and Core of a Ravencoin-hardfork Cryptocurrency. \
School project developed in 2019 which made use of the now deprecated Bitcoin RPC infrastructure.
### Defl8-master
ERC20 Project on Ethereum with a "free-claim" Web3 application
### Ethereum-Game
Proof of concept console-game on Ethereum with little functionaliy ( only walking in 2D )
### GeckoTools
Tool to analyse and track cryptocurrencies on Coingecko, at the time ahead of the actual service but now they caught up so no need for this tool.
### JCC-proof-of-work
A proof of work cryptocurrency built in Python ( from scratch )
### LayerZeroNFT
Example for a Layerzero NFT collection with simple backend, nothing special imo.
### Neural-Network
Solve a custom minesweeper game with no hidden layers. Works but is inefficient ( because of no hidden layers )
### artmuc
A custom online shop built from scratch for artists in Munich with a Stripe payment gateway and access restriction for creators (=exclusiveness)
### casper-sandbox-v1
My first react app, built on the Casper Blockchain. Replaced by jonas089/VE-project ( much better )
### coiffeur-website
Small website for Coiffeur in Zurich (frontend with GoogleMaps).
### inpigritas2020
Inpigritas is a python Blockchain project of mine. 2020 is the old, deprecated version and I still occasionally work on the 2022 version of it. It's a fun project and I learnd a lot coding it up and improving it.
